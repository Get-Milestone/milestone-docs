# Unified Queue

## What It Is
A single, centralized view of all client requests across your MSP.

## Why MSPs Use It
- Triage all work from one place  
- Filter by client, status, SLA, assignee  
- Sort by SLA expiring, oldest, newest  

## How to Use
1. Open Milestone → Unified Queue  
2. Apply filters or sorting  
3. Select a request to open details  
4. Respond, log hours, update status  

## Tip
**Sort by "SLA Expiring" each morning to see urgent items first.**
