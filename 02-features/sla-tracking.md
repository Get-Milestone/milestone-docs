# SLA Tracking

## What It Is
Automatic timers for response and resolution SLAs.

## Why MSPs Use It
- Prevent SLA breaches  
- Identify at-risk requests  
- Improve response reliability  

## How It Works
- Response timer starts at creation → stops on first agent reply  
- Resolution timer runs until issue is resolved  
- Warnings at 75%  
- Red indicator if breached  

## Tip
Set per-client SLA overrides for VIP clients.
