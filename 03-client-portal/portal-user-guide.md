## Submitting a Request

### How to Submit

1. Click **New Request** (on dashboard or in navigation)
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Title**: Brief summary of your need
   - **Description**: Detailed explanation
   - **Urgency**: How quickly you need this addressed
   - **Category**: Type of request (if applicable)
3. Click **Submit**

### Writing a Good Request

**Good request:**
> **Title:** Unable to access financial reports after update
>
> **Description:** Since yesterday's update, clicking "Reports" in the Finance module shows a blank page. Error message says "Access Denied." This affects the entire accounting team (5 people). We need these reports for month-end close on Friday.
>
> **Urgency:** High

**Vague request (avoid):**
> **Title:** Reports broken
>
> **Description:** Can't see reports.

The more detail you provide, the faster we can help.

### Urgency Levels

| Level | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| **Low** | No deadline, can be addressed whenever convenient |
| **Normal** | Standard work, no special time pressure |
| **High** | Impacts your business, needs attention soon |
| **Critical** | Blocking your operations, needs immediate attention |

Choose honestly—everything being "critical" slows down actual emergencies.

## Tracking Your Requests

### Viewing Open Requests

1. Go to **Requests** → **Open Requests**
2. See all your active requests in one list
3. Each shows: title, status, SLA timer

### Understanding Status

| Status | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **Submitted** | We've received your request |
| **In Progress** | We're actively working on it |
| **Completed** | Work is done, issue resolved |

### Understanding SLA Timers

SLA (Service Level Agreement) timers show our committed response and resolution times:

- **Response SLA**: When you'll hear back from us
- **Resolution SLA**: When the work should be complete

**Timer Colors:**
- 🟢 Green = On track, plenty of time
- 🟡 Yellow = Approaching deadline, we're aware
- 🔴 Red = Past deadline, we're addressing it

### Viewing Request Details

Click any request to see:
- Full description
- Status history
- Messages exchanged
- Hours logged (if applicable)

### Viewing Past Requests

Go to **Requests** → **Closed Requests** to see your history. Useful for:
- Finding past solutions
- Reviewing what was done
- Auditing work completed

## Communicating with Your Team

### Sending Messages

1. Open a request
2. Find the **Messages** section
3. Type your message
4. Click **Send**

Your message goes directly to your service team and appears in their queue.

### When to Message

✅ **Good reasons to message:**
- Providing requested information
- Asking for a status update
- Adding important context
- Confirming resolution works

❌ **Better handled differently:**
- Completely new issues (submit new request)
- Unrelated questions (submit new request)
- Urgent emergencies (call directly)

### Receiving Responses

When your service team responds:
- Their message appears in the request
- Check the portal regularly for updates

---

## Understanding Your Hours

### Hours Dashboard

Your dashboard shows:
- **Purchased**: Total hours allocated to you
- **Consumed**: Hours used so far
- **Remaining**: Balance available

### How Hours Work

When your service team works on your requests, they log time. This time:
- Deducts from your hour bank
- Is visible in your portal
- Appears on individual requests

### Per-Request Hours

Open any request to see hours logged specifically for that work.

### Running Low on Hours?

If your balance is low:
- Your service team will likely contact you
- You can request additional hours
- Discuss options with your account manager

## Tips for Best Results

### Be Specific
The more context you provide, the faster and better we can help. Include:
- What you're trying to do
- What's happening instead
- Any error messages
- Who is affected

### Check Before Submitting
Before creating a new request:
- Search your past requests—might already be solved
- Check if colleagues submitted similar request
- Gather all relevant details

### Communicate in the Portal
Keep all request communication in the portal:
- Creates a record we can reference
- Ensures the right team sees it
- Tracks everything in one place

### Set Realistic Urgency
Accurate urgency helps us prioritize effectively. If everything is marked critical, nothing gets prioritized correctly.

### Check Regularly
Log in periodically to:
- See responses to your requests
- Track progress on open items
- Review your hours balance
